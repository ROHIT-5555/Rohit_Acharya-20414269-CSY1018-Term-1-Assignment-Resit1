Here, I am talking about experience on gaining the basic of knowledge on Web Development. I am presenting you my experience as an informal conversation between my lecturer and me: <br>

A: Hello Rohit, How are you?<br> 
R: Hello sir, I am fine thank you <br> 
A: so why were you absent this long days? We have almost completed our course? 
R: Actually I had not been well due to that reason I couldn’t come to the collage. Up to which topic have we completed till now? Regarding the completed one I have been seeking help from my classmates. <br>
A: Oh! That’s great to hear that. We have completed till week-12. If you have problem regarding any topic please do connect with me. <br>
R: sure sir, I will definitely be getting In touch with you. <br> 
A: so, what are the experiences gained by you till now regarding the topics that we have covered till now?  <br>
R: the main experience that I have gained till now is the methodology of creating a simple webpage design using the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. <br> 
A: ok, can you explain me what HTML and CSS means in brief? <br>
R: sure sir, HTML which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language is a basic of programming language. We can also compare HTML as the basic foundation of building. Using this language we can define how the contents of web are to be designed. This is just a description on the appearance of the webpage. <br>
    Similarly, CSS which stands for Cascading Style sheets. With this also we can say that this is the core technology used in building a webpage. We can take up an example of a blueprint of a house as CSS and the property as an HTML. While building a house the structure and design made in building will be in accordance to the blue print of the house. Similarly, CSS provides the structure to the design that we have thought of before building a webpage. <br> 
A: well understood, great to hear that. Now can you tell me how do you design a webpage? <br>
R: sure sir in order to design a webpage we need to follow the following steps and techniques: <br>
 Step-1: First up before diving up to the design phase we need to know the basic knowledge on HTML and CSS. <br> 
Step-2: Secondly, we need to know the structure of HTML documents. <br> 
Step-3:  after that we need to know the CSS Selectors (specifically used to select the HTML element that you would like to style). <br>
Step4:    after following up the step-3 we need to bind up all the documents of HTML and CSS together. <br>
Step5:  in this step, we need to install and download Bootstraps (bootstraps generally refers to the open-source kit for designing a webpage). <br> 
Step-6: after following up all the above mentioned steps now we need to choose up the design for the webpage. <br>
Step-7: after step-6, going in with the design that we have thought of we need to apply the knowledge of HTML and CSS to it in order to give a final results of webpage. 
Step-8: now we need to give up the beauty to the webpage by adding up more content to the design like adding up images, changing the title etc. <br> 
Step-9: add up the layouts using CSS to the HTML document. <br>
      These are the basic steps while building up the webpage. <br>
A: wow excellent. Now tell me the steps required for debugging? <br>
R: regarding the debugging process we need to follow the following steps: <br> 
  Step-1: Firstly download the file that you would like to debug or save the document that you are continuing to work with locally. <br>
Step-2: open the saved document in the browser. <br>
Step-3: now check out the codes for any faults or errors. <br> 
Step-4: Review the problem that you have faced along. This means that you need to check out the correct standards for the HTML tags and correct them accordingly. <br> 
Step-5: Repeat Step-2 <br>
Step-6: Inspect the page that you have worked along for any further errors. <br> 
  A: fabulous. Now what were the ups and downs that you faced along while creating a webpage? <br>
  R: talking you about the down that I faced along while designing the page is that first up all I found it a bit difficult while managing the content of the page in proper and appropriate manner. I also had more errors coming along while designing. So I took a bit help from social Medias as well as my classmates to come along with the beautiful project. <br> 
       Talking you about the ups doing this project I came to know much more than I knew about HTML and CSS. Also I knew the knowledge on how we can design a beautiful webpage by using HTML and CSS.  <br> 
A: So pleased to hear that. I wish you luck for the upcoming days and hope your assignment will be a great one. Now, I need to depart, see you good bye. <br> 
R: thank you sir, I will try to come up with the best. Good to see you sir, bye.

                                                     <h2>   Reflective Discussion on Module Experience <br></h2>
                      This module has been a great boon to me throughout this semester. I really enjoyed a lot in creating a webpage through the knowledge of HTML & CSS. It has been fruitful in developing up my skill and understanding on each of the topics covered. Through this I have been able to build   up my confidence and with this I can strongly say that I will be able to build as many webpages in the upcoming days. <br>
            The module as an entirety has empowered me to see advance into particular regions which are of intrigued to me & those I did not have tall certainty in conveying inside the classroom. Coming along to the collage and involving myself into various activities has not only made me strong enough but also enabled me to build but not only my communication skill but also has helped me to build up me carrer. I can confidently say that I can be a good web developer in the upcoming days. Additionally, it has been pleasure to me in doing up the task in classrooms, this has been quite a great moment for me. Facing up various errors during the tasks has made me aware of the threats that might come along in my way if I need to develop a webpage in the near future. The inspiration & support we given to each other was important. I feel I have learnt a parcel from them as experts, sharing thoughts and considerations almost numerous diverse issues – seeing distinctive points of view and empowering me to create my possess considering <br>

                     The main reason that I decided to design the portfolio webpage was that since it was our first project so we were expected to have a basic knowledge on HTML and CSS and also we were likely to know all the steps and procedures that are followed while designing a webpage. As an layout I decided to bring up the design in a separate manner where all the content that are included in are clear to everyone. I accept I felt these would challenge me due to not having much involvement within the regions, hence supporting my proficient improvement. For the foremost portion, these errands have been agreeable to total. It was a nonstop prepare all through the module with the lion's share of errands being completed sometime recently the conclusion of October. I feel that by doing them all through the module it has taken a few push absent from the completion of the task as an entirety. I chose to do this portfolio as a web journal on Shine due to feeling like I needed to form it a bit more intelligently instead of fair word archives on a USB. In expansion, I needed to once more challenge myself but too make a begin on building an asset bank/reflection for my future career & proficient advancement. Having this online and on Shine implies I will continuously have get to the data as typically a framework instructors proceed to use in practice. <br>
                                 In conclusion it was a wonderful journey to choose this module and has helped me a lot in a great way.

                               Client Interface (UI) Plan centers on foreseeing what clients might got to do and guaranteeing that the interface has components that are simple to get to, get it, and utilize to encourage those activities. UI brings together concepts from interaction plan, visual plan, and data engineering. <br>
     Coming along the designing phase of my portfolio I choose the following contents to give up a professional look. <br>
For the index.html page I decided to come along a unique design. I decided to divide the entire browser into their respective header, sidebar, main and footer. After division I separated the respective columns as white in the sidebar, red as a header element and as the main content I choose the background as grey. <br>

        So for to divide the entire browser was quite difficult and challenging to me in the beginning but later with the help of guides I was able to do so for that I used up the following codes into an HTML document. <br>
